ECO-FRIENDLY FAST BOIL: Not all tea and coffee drinks require water at the highest temperature of 100°c, however with a standard kettle you have no choice but to boil your water to the higher temperature (using more power) and then have to either make your drink with water that destroys the taste of the cup and also wastes power unnecessarily. With the EK30 kettle you can boil water to the temperature you need, saving you time and money at the same time.
VARIABLE TEMPERATURE CONTROL: Easy to reach buttons on the handle of this kettle allow you to alter the temperature of the water you want to heat. Choose from 40°c, 60°c, 90°c or 100°c depending on what beverage you are making. 40°c is ideal for Lemsips and hot water bottles, 60°c is for unique coffees, 80°c is ideal for tea and coffee, and 100°c is for black tea and other herbal teas.
KEEP WARM FUNCTION: Another great function of this Duronic water boiler is that after heating your water you can press the Keep Warm button to keep the water in the kettle at the same hot temperature for up to 30 minutes. This is perfect if you usually like to go for second drink after your first one, of if you know someone else will want a hot drink shortly after you.
CORDLESS DESIGN WITH ADDED SAFETY FEATURES: For safety and convenience reasons we have designed this kettle to be cordless and have a 360° base which enables you to lift the kettle from any direction you wish making it idea for both left-handed and right-handed users. Additional safety features include auto shut-off and boil dry protection.

ECO-FRIENDLY FAST BOIL: Some tea and coffee drinks require boiling water, and some others don’t. Using boiling water on coffee for instance, burns the coffee granules and gives it a bitter flavour. With the EK42 kettle you can avoid this problem by boiling your water to less-than-boiling temperatures. Not only does it make your drink taste nice, it also saves energy too.
VARIABLE TEMPERATURE CONTROL: Easy to reach buttons on the handle of this kettle allow you to alter the temperature of the water you want to heat up. Choose from 40°c, 60°c, 90°c or 100°c depending on what beverage you are making. 40°c is ideal for Lemsips and hot water bottles, 60°c is for unique coffees, 80°c is ideal for tea and standard coffees, and 100°c is for black tea and some other herbal teas.
KEEP WARM FUNCTION: Another great function of this Duronic water boiler is that after heating your water up you can press the ‘Keep Warm’ button to keep the water in the kettle at the same hot temperature for up to 30 minutes. This is perfect if you usually like to go for second drink after your first one, of if you know someone else will want a hot drink shortly after you.
CORDLESS DESIGN WITH ADDED SAFETY FEATURES: For safety and convenience reasons we have designed this kettle to be cordless and have a 360° base which enables you to lift the kettle from any direction you wish making it idea for both left-handed and right-handed users.
